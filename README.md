A music storage system where you can store and play music. Still being worked on.

HOW TO USE (SO FAR):

Put albums in folders, must be in bandcamp format.

node GenerateAlbum.js generates album from directories in assets, so make sure album is in a file that is the name of the album.


TO DO LIST (For front-end):

-Make it so selected songs chage color

-Make it so user can make playlists

-Make it so user can search for songs that are downloaded

-Make log in screen work, as well as create account and forgot password

-Improve song loading and playing times, maybe pre-load the music? DONE, IMPROVE LOADING TIMES SOMEHOW (CHUNKS? PARALLEL?)

-Add progress bar for downloaded music / music that still needs to be downloaded

-Other stuff
